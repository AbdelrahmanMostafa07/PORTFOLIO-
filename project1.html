    <h1>Data Cleaning and Analysis in Cricket Statistics</h1>

    <!-- Project Image -->

    <!-- Project Description -->
    <div class="project-section">
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>In this project, I tackled the intricacies of cleaning and analyzing a dataset containing cricket player statistics. The dataset, sourced from <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910" target="_blank">ESPNcricinfo</a></p>
        <p>required extensive cleaning to prepare it for meaningful analysis.
        The primary goal was to enhance the dataset's quality, enabling more accurate insights into the performance of cricket players.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Code Organization -->
    <div class="project-section">
        <h3>Code Organization:</h3>
        <p>The code is organized logically, leveraging Python and the pandas library for efficient data manipulation. 
        Each step is accompanied by comments explaining the rationale behind the decisions made during the cleaning process. 
        For instance, I utilized the fillna method to handle missing values in critical columns such as 'Balls_Faced' and 'Strike_Rate.'</p>

    <!-- Additional Details -->
    <div class="project-section">
        <h3>Additional Details:</h3>
        <p>The dataset presented challenges, such as missing values and inconsistent formats, which I addressed methodically. 
        I opted for a careful approach, verifying data uniqueness after splitting the 'Span' column into 'Rookie-Year' and 'Final-Year' to ensure accurate analysis.</p>

    <!-- Displaying Results -->
    <div class="project-section">
        <h3>Displaying Results:</h3>
        <p>The analysis delved into cricket player statistics, utilizing advanced statistical calculations to derive meaningful insights. Through careful examination and manipulation of the dataset, key questions were addressed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q1:</strong> Calculated the average career length of players.</li>
            <li><strong>Q2:</strong> Determined the average batting strike rate for cricketers with over 10 years of play.</li>
            <li><strong>Q3:</strong> Found the number of cricketers who played before 1960.</li>
            <li><strong>Q4:</strong> Identified the maximum highest innings score by country.</li>
            <li><strong>Q5:</strong> Computed the average number of points scored by players for each country, considering hundreds, fifties, and ducks (0).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The results, derived solely from data analysis and without the use of visual aids, 
            contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cricket player performances and historical trends.</p>

    <!-- Final Results -->
    <div class="project-section">
        <h3>Final Results:</h3>
        <p>After a meticulous analysis of players' career length and batting strike rates over a decade, the focus was on achieving clean and error-free data. 
            The mean career length and average strike rates for players with over 10 years of experience were calculated, contributing to the final results.</p>
        
        <p>The culmination of the project involved thorough data cleaning, ensuring the dataset's integrity by addressing issues and errors. 
            The refined data now stands as a reliable foundation for drawing meaningful conclusions and insights into cricket players' performances.</p>
